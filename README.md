**instructions**    
```npm i```   
```npm start```

It will connect to API's running on port 3000 ( see voicemod-api repo).

Due to a problem with Ubuntu 20 and nodejs LTS i could not create a proper docker container for this project. (Please check start method on package.json to understand better. You might also want to remove `--openssl-legacy-provider` from the start command if on mac, or use set PORT=4000 if on windows ).

**TECH**

React (ofc :) ), redux toolkit, jest, and Material design. I went directly for material design for lack of time ( and proper figmas ). It ensures a good result with minimum effort.
